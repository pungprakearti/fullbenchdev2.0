&nbsp &nbsp I'm super into incremental clicker/idle games. I love them! I thought it would be cool to build my personal site into a game where you unlock all of the categories by clicking all of the information about me. Then once a section was revealed, you could click on the section to gain points. Each section would gain a resource for other sections to unlock or use. The final section would be in the middle and clicking that would give you resources for all of the sections. It was supposed to be a metaphor for a full stack developer having all of these skills.
  
I ran out of time and thought the idea was pretty cheesy and most companies wouldn't like it/get it. So, I scrapped the idea and rebuilt another site from scratch.

If I had more time, I think it would be fun to complete the game and let people try it out.

The site was built in vanilla React with SASS and painfully manipulating CSS because I didn't know of css-grids.
